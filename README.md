### Hello Mr. Nikita Milka! 
My name is Ilya Zinkov. Currently I am working in sales area and I’d like to switch my occupation to something new :sunglasses:. It happened so, that in my circle there are many IT-workers and communication with them made Software Testing topic interesting for me.
Now I started my IT jorney with [acodemy.lv](https://acodemy.lv/ru) courses. I think its a great opportunity for me to start.
On these courses I will have an understanding about how software development process works. In nearest feature I’m going to start learning how to write `auto-tests`. ![QA]()
Despite the fact that my work in the field of sales is not connected with development and testing, it still gave me a lot of experience in terms of communicating with people and greatly developed my soft skills, such as , for example:
- problem solving;
- planning.

Hope to hear soon feedback from you!
